**Space Hunt Extraordinaire**

Maanya had never been so thrilled in her life! Any twelve-year-old would be, if given the chance to visit the No Man’s Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Maanya’s father Dr Gogoi, an eminent astronomer was working there on Project Hynek, a classified science project. Maanya was allowed to accompany him on the condition that she would not say a word about it to anyone or boast about it to her friends.

Maanya and Dr Gogoi reached the airport for their flight to Zimabo, a country close to No Man’s Islands. Maanya only knew that Project Hynek had something to do with catching UFOs.  
‘At last I will know,’ she thought, as she leaned back in her seat. 

When they landed at Zimabo, Dr Smith, an astronomer, received them and led them to a waiting helicopter in a deserted corner. Maanya’s eyes shone with excitement.  
Soon they were flying above the ocean.  
“Why didn’t we fly straight to the No Man’s Islands?” asked Maanya curiously.  
Dr Smith chuckled. “No direct access is allowed to Project Hynek!” he said. “Only helicopters can fly there under controlled conditions. The powerful magnetic fields that are generated on the islands are dangerous for any metallic object. So no aircraft can enter an area of about 4,000 square kilometres around the islands, without permission. These islands were chosen partly because they’re far away from shipping routes and flight paths.”

Soon Dr Dominique, another scientist walked up to them. “I’m Pierre Dominique. I will escort you to Dr Hoyle, the Chief of Control, Project Hynek.”  
Dr Gogoi told Maanya, “Dr Hoyle is a good friend of mine. If you have any questions, you can ask him.”  
Dr Dominique said to Maanya, “I will show you around first.”  
Dr Dominique and Maanya went out. The island had some whitish domes here and there. Clusters of palm trees swayed in the cool breeze. The incessant breaking of waves could be heard.  
Dr Dominique and Maanya approached a huge dome, the Control Station of the project. The large screens on the walls showed the UFO Net from different angles.  
Scientists sitting in front of screens were monitoring everything and talking to each other through microphones.  
Maanya sat quietly with Dr Dominique who briefed her about Project Hynek. She guessed that something was about to happen.  
“The basic aim of this project, named after the late J Allen Hynek, the American astronomer who first investigated the UFO phenomenon, is to capture a UFO.  
“You must have seen that the magnetic needle in a compass is always aligned in the north-south direction. It has been observed that whenever a UFO is sighted, the magnetic needles in its vicinity lose their property of magnetism temporarily. Maybe the UFO’s propulsion system produces a magnetic field that neutralizes the magnetic field around the needles. If the magnetic field of the UFO could be neutralized, the UFO would stop functioning and could be caught. Experiments conducted years ago found that a UFO went haywire when it encountered a powerful magnetic field.  
“At the mouth of the UFO Net there are powerful magnets that produce intense magnetic fields, which can be felt within a radius of ten kilometers.”

Maanya was about to ask a question when a shrill beep sounded and a red bulb lit up.  
“You will soon see the flight of the UFO Net,” said Dr Dominique excitedly. “You are lucky I must say!”  
Maanya looked at the screen expectantly. Nothing happened for a while. The giant UFO Net stood defiantly.  
“Watch the rim closely!” exclaimed Dr Dominique.  
The jets of smoke at the rim soon became dense and dark. The scaffolding on both sides of the Net fell. The thick smoke blotted out everything on the screen. Gradually, the smoke became less dense to reveal an empty space – the Net had flown away!  
“The remote-controlled cameras, pointed at the Net, will soon let you see the Net in proper perspective when it gains altitude. Ah! There you are!” said Dr Dominique.  
The rapidly changing numerical figures and words on the screens indicated that the Net was moving higher at a tremendous speed.  
“Young lady!” said Dr Dominique. “You’re about to witness something extremely rare – the first space hunt extraordinaire. It seems a group of UFOs has just been sighted!”  
Maanya stared at the screens with bated breath.  
Dr Dominique continued. “We have been trying to match the flight of the Net with the probable appearance of UFOs and it . . .”  
Before he could complete his sentence, some of the screens went blank but they were soon live again. A group of small glowing dots, possibly UFOs, appeared on the screen. Maanya’s heart began to thump hard!  
As the Net rose, the glowing dots grew in size. One of them left the cluster and came whirling down towards the Net. Perhaps it was a scout trying to inspect the Net. The figures on the screen stopped moving. The Net stood still.  
“Till now, the UFO has not exhibited any crazy behavior,” continued Dr Dominique. “But soon, I am sure, it will come under the influence of the Net’s magnetic field. Voila, it has!”  
The golden ball on the screen shook and zigzagged towards the Net. The Net immediately went into action and rushed towards the UFO swiftly. The UFO, already shaky, lost height and changed its color from yellow to orange to red. The Net moved fast, came right below the falling UFO and turned its ‘mouth’ upwards. The red ball went tumbling straight into the monstrous Net.  
Just then, the screens went blank. Contact with the Net was lost at that crucial moment! The scientists tried to re-establish contact and waited for something to appear on the screens. But nothing happened. ‘Is the project a failure?’ wondered Maanya.  
A dejected Dr Dominique, led Maanya out of the hall and into the open. Even Dr Gogoi’s face was pale and sad.  
Soon Dr Smith accompanied them back to Zimabo. Throughout the ride, no one said a word about Project Hynek or the Net. Maanya realized that something unfortunate had happened.  
A few weeks later Maanya asked her father hesitantly.  
“Papa, there was something I didn’t understand about the No Man’s Islands. If the Net produces a strong magnetic field, how come it doesn’t affect the gadgets inside the control station and other places?”  
“Magnetic lines of force, however strong, cannot enter a hollow metallic object. That’s why all the houses on the islands were hollow spheres of metal. You could only see the upper half of the domes. Their lower halves were under the ground,” explained Dr Gogoi.  
“But what happened to Project Hynek? Was the UFO eventually captured?”

### Chapter 2: The Blue Carbuncle

**GET SET**
Who wouldn’t be excited on Christmas Eve, especially in London in 1888? The city was bustling with people doing their last-minute Christmas shopping, and the air was filled with the sounds of carolers singing merrily. But for a certain doctor and his famous friend, this Christmas Eve would turn out to be quite extraordinary. Let's find out why.

**The Blue Carbuncle**

It was the second morning after Christmas, and Sherlock Holmes was in a slightly festive mood. As he sat in his cozy armchair, he remarked on the various presents that had been sent to him by grateful clients. He was examining a magnifying glass which had come from the reigning family of Holland, and a small snuffbox from the King of Bohemia. Just then, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in!” called Holmes. The door opened to reveal a stout, florid-faced old man in a bowler hat and a grey overcoat.  
“Good morning, Peterson,” said Holmes cheerily.  
“Good morning, sir,” said Peterson, a commissionaire by profession. He placed a battered felt hat and a goose on the table.  
“Here’s your hat and your goose, Mr. Holmes,” said Peterson.  
“My hat and my goose? What are you talking about?”  
“I’m sorry, sir, but I seem to have brought you a little adventure. I found these things on Tottenham Court Road at about four o’clock in the morning. They were lying in the street. The goose was tied to the hat. There was no name or address on them.”

Holmes looked thoughtfully at the hat and the goose.  
“Well, Peterson, this is a most interesting little problem. Let’s see what we can make of it. Watson, you know my methods. What do you make of the hat?”  
I took up the battered hat and examined it with care. It was of good quality, with a lining of silk. The initials ‘H.B.’ were stamped on the inside, but it was stained and spotted with age.  
“It’s a well-worn hat,” I said. “The owner must have been a man of some wealth, for it is a very good hat. But he has evidently fallen on hard times, as the hat is not new and is much in need of repair.”  
“Excellent, Watson!” said Holmes. “Your powers of observation are improving. Now, let us turn our attention to the goose

. Peterson, please pass me the bird.”

Peterson handed the goose to Holmes, who examined it carefully.  
“It’s a fine bird,” said Holmes. “Quite fat and well-fed. It has been recently killed. There are some little irregularities in the feathers, which suggest that it has been roughly plucked. But, apart from that, it is a very ordinary goose.”  
“Shall we eat it?” suggested Watson.  
Holmes laughed. “Not yet, my dear Watson. There is still the mystery to be solved. Peterson, can you tell me anything more about where you found these items?”  
“Yes, sir,” said Peterson. “I was walking home from a late shift when I saw a scuffle in the street. A man in a white hat was being attacked by some roughs. They knocked him down, and he dropped the hat and the goose. I chased them off, but the man ran away as well. I picked up the hat and the goose, thinking they might be clues to who he was.”
